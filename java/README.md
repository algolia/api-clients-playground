#  â˜• Java Playground

## Install OpenJDK 8 or above

First you need to install **Java** on your machine. Download and install [JDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/).

```sh
java -version 
```

Should output something like (if you installed JDK8) : 
```
java version "1.8.0_181"
```

## Install an IDE

You can use multiple IDEs with Java. I would recommend you -in that order- the following:

- [IntelijIDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Check that maven is installed

```sh
mvn -version 
```

If the command gives no output, go [there](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) to install maven.

## Play!

Run the main method with your favorite IDE.
