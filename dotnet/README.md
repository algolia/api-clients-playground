# Algolia's .NET console

## .NET environment setup

You can skip this part if you already have the .NET framework installed.

### .NET Core SDK 2.x

Download and install the .NET Core SDK from [.NET Downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core). 

If you have problems with the installation on MacOS, consult the [Known issues](https://github.com/dotnet/core/tree/master/release-notes/2.0) topic for the version you have installed.

To check if dotnet is correctly installed :

```shell
dotnet --version
```

You should have something like this depending on the version you have installed :

```shell
2.1.402
```

If you have the following message `dotnet command not found`. Please run the following command :

```shell
export PATH=/usr/local/share/dotnet:$PATH
```

### Visual studio Code

If you don't have it, you should download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is in my opinion, the best .NET IDE for MacOS at the moment.

Once you have downloaded Visual Studio Code, I recommend you to install some usefull VSCode's plugins.
